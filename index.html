<h1 id="fifostrpy">fifostr.py</h1>

<p>FIFOStr - A small python library for mutable strings with a built-in streaming pattern parser.  </p>

<p>FIFOstr was originally used for combining deque with pattern-trigger operations for an embedded terminal program.  It allows pieces of a string to be treated in a mutable way with operations that you would expect from a bi-directional list such as insertion at either end and adding/removing N chars from either end.  </p>

<h2 id="patterntriggeringfeatures">Pattern Triggering Features</h2>

<p>Built-in pattern matching and triggering:  simply add / remove patterns which then call a callback function (E.g. if the pattern is "seen" then trigger the function).  Patterns can be strings, regexes or user-supplied-functions (parsers written in python). A pattern consists of:  </p>

<ul>
<li>pattern: string <em>or</em> compiled regex <em>or</em> user-supplied-parser-function  </li>

<li>label: user supplied 'name' for this pattern  </li>

<li>start index : position in fifostr to begin pattern match.  default is 0  (also accepts the character '^' as start anchor for those familiar with regexes)</li>

<li>stop index : position in fifostr to end pattern match.  default is end of fifostr.  the letter '$' has special meaning as end of string no matter the length  (again regex)</li>

<li>callback_fn : called if pattern is found, fifostr(start:end) and the label are passed to the callback function  (callback('thematchingstring','label'))</li>

<li>active : default is True, sets whether this pattern should be actively looked for  </li>
</ul>

<p>Originally a lighter version of this was used in a python serial terminal program dioterm (which allowed the serial terminal to parse commands sent/received by both sides).  </p>

<p>And finally .. I just wanted to get some practice on python module packaging ... </p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<pre><code>pip install fifostr # or just pull fifostr.py from the source repository and put in your source path  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="originalusage">Original Usage</h3>

<p>Originally part of a terminal program called 'dioterm' (albeit in much more compact form), this library was used used to 'listen' to traffic in either direction on a serial port.  When certain patterns were found such as a command sent from the host or a special piece of data from the embedded microntroller client, fifostr would trigger a callback to do something.  This was very useful when sequences of commands had to be set up between the host and client.  Many of these sequences where conditional based on what either the host or client sent resulting in many variations of sequence-test cases, especially if this results in the host then having to make some other call to an unrelated process or hardware to reply correctly.</p>

<h3 id="functionality">Functionality</h3>

<p>FIFOStr is a string which is (derived from deque) with these properties:  </p>

<ul>
<li>add/remove chars or strings at either end   </li>

<li>mutable (can set a char to any value like an array with [])</li>

<li>use slices, lists, or tuples to retrieve members (just like a real str object)   </li>

<li>get head/tail (returns as a str)  </li>

<li>match head/tail  --> match a supplied string to either the head or tail  </li>

<li>use patterns to trigger callbacks  --> pattern can be string | regex | user<em>supplied</em>parser any of which triggers user supplied callback<em>fn <br />


<ul>
<li>all patterns can look at either the whole fifostr or any subset e.g. addPattern("foo",myCallback,2,5,"bar") 
--> only looks for "foo" between positions 2 and 5 in the fifostr and will call myCallback with ("foo","bar")  if found</li>

<li>all patterns have optional label which can be used for logging purposes (eg. when pattern found, in addition to callback, emit label)  </li>

<li>user supplied callback</em>fn is called with both the string-match section and the label  </li>

<li>patterns can be added/deleted from the list of patterns "watching" the fifostr content</li>

<li>all (active) patterns are always matched.  fifostr matches multiple different patterns over the same string.  </li></ul>
</li>

<li>clear all patterns --> removes patterns from processing  </li>

<li>get/setPattern Active/Inactive  --> allows a stored pattern to set on or off  </li>

<li>Python 2.7+, Python 3+ support with no mods, no dependancies  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="usageexample">Usage example</h3>

<p>See example.py to run in tests dir -- same examples as here but more comments, more use cases  </p>

<pre><code class=" python language- python">from fifostr import FIFOStr
def main():
    myFifoStr=FIFOStr(5) #make a fifostr of length 5 (for unlimited length omit number)
    myFifoStr+='1234567' #adds 1234567 to fifostr ... but len of fifostr is 5
                         # so only 34567 is retained

    print "myFifoStr.head(3)= ",myFifoStr.head(3) #shows 345
    print "myFifoStr.tail(4)= ",myFifoStr.tail(4) #shows 4567

    # the eqhead and eqtail functions allow string compares against
    # the head or the tail

    myFifoStr.eqhead("3456")    #True
    myFifoStr.eqhead("567")     #False
    myFifoStr.eqtail("4567")    #True
    myFifoStr.eqtail("abc")     #False

    #fifostr.testPattern() allows you to test if the pattern is present in the fifostr object
    #test a  string pattern directly
    myFifoStr.testPattern('67890') #False

    #test a regex pattern directly.  to do this pass any valid regex in compiled form
    r1=re.compile("[0-9]+")
    myFifoStr.testPattern(r1)   #True

    r2=re.compile("[a-z]+")
    myFifoStr.testPattern(r2)   #False

    #more generally we can add (and remove) patterns which will scan and trigger a call back everytime the fifostr 
    #internal content changes (whether adding or deleting chars from either end or even rotating/reversing the fifstr object)

    #adding patterns
    p1 = myFifoStr.addPattern("234",logf,label="234 was here") #integer index returned managing pattern 
    p2 = myFifoStr.addPattern("67890",logf,label="67890 detected")
    p3 = myFifoStr.addPattern(r1,logf,label="r1 detected")
    myFifoStr.addPattern(r2,logf,label="r2 hit")
    myFifoStr.addPattern(f1,logf,label="f1 hit")   
    myFifoStr.addPattern(f2,logf,label="f2 hit")    

    #patterns can be set active/inactive via pattern management fns 
    myFifoStr.setPatternActiveState(p1,False) #based on index returned from addPattern

    #now show searching for stored pattern matchers in the pattern dict
    #this is not searching the fifo-string itself, just the stored patterns that we have entered
    print("find pattern by label 'foo':",myFifoStr.findPatternByLabel("foo")) #no matches returns empty list
    print("find pattern by label '234 hit':",myFifoStr.findPatternByLabel("234 hit")) #shows match
    print("find pattern by label using regex '[rf][0-9]':")
    pp.pprint(myFifoStr.findPatternByLabel(re.compile("[rf][0-9]")))

    #and finally demonstrate that patterns auto-trigger when items inserted in fifostr .. which afterall
    #is the point of the whole thing.. ;)
    print("\n fifo operations ============")
    for c in '01234567890abcdefghijklmnop':  #show using inc which accomplishes same thing
        myFifoStr += c

    myFifoStr+= 'abcdefghi'
    print (myFifoStr.all())

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>Absolutley <em>no</em> warranties on performance.  This is not replacement for a compiler/parser front end!  It just iterates over stored patterns every time something is added to the 
fifostr object.  If you do have a parser you wish to be called then just add it as a function so that every time the fifostr is updated with a char it will call your parser to do the work.   Your parser must return a boolean result if you wish to use the callback based triggering.</p>

<pre><code>#let your own parser do the work  
    myFifo = fifostr(20)  # make a 20 char fifostr
    myFifo.addPattern(myParser,myCallbk) #myParser passed entire fifostr (as str) when char(s) added
    myFifo.addPattern(myParser,myCallbk2,3,5) #myParser passed fifostr btw (3,5).  My Parser must return True if match found for callback to be invoked

<h3 id="docs">Docs</h3>

<p>documentation is in /docs directory (generated by pydoc)
to (re)generate the docs.  cd to the docs directory. then type:</p>

<pre><code>pydoc -w ../fifostr.py

<p>note that as of this writing pydoc generates its output in the current directory and doesn't seem to be pipeable to another.  </p>

<h3 id="readmemdvsreadmerst">README.md vs README.rst</h3>

<p>The README.rst is generated from the README.md using pandoc but the content is identical.  This has to do with uneven support of markdown vs ReStructured Text on github vs PyPi.</p>
